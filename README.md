## Overview

This system accepts raw email text through a web dashboard and classifies it as **Spam** or **Ham** using a trained Machine Learning model. The backend is a Python Flask REST API. The frontend is a responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript single-page dashboard served by Flask.

The ML pipeline consists of:

1. NLP text preprocessing (lowercase → URL removal → tokenisation → stopword removal → lemmatisation)
2. TF-IDF feature vectorisation (5,000 features, unigrams + bigrams)
3. Classification using the best-performing model selected from four candidates trained on the SMS Spam Collection dataset (5,572 emails)

The deployed model is a **Linear Support Vector Machine** (Accuracy: **98.3%**, F1: **93.33%** on the test set).

---

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1 — Install Python

Download and install Python **3.10 or later** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

During installation on Windows, check **"Add Python to PATH"**.

Verify your installation:

```bash
python --version
# Expected: Python 3.10.x or later
```

### Step 2 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adityagupta-mits/Email-spam-classifier-
cd Email-spam-classifier-
```

> **Note:** Replace the URL above with your actual GitHub repository URL if it differs.

### Step 3 — Create a virtual environment

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt.

### Step 4 — Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs: Flask, flask-cors, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, nltk, joblib, Werkzeug, requests.

> NLTK corpora (`punkt`, `wordnet`, `stopwords`, `omw-1.4`) are downloaded automatically on first run if not already present. An internet connection is required for this step.

### Step 5 — Train the model (if model files are not included)

If the `model/` directory does not contain `spam_model.pkl` and `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`, run the training script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will:
1. Load (or download) the SMS Spam Collection dataset into `dataset/emails.csv`
2. Preprocess all 5,572 emails using the NLP pipeline
3. Train and evaluate four ML models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, Random Forest)
4. Save the best-performing model and TF-IDF vectoriser to `model/`

> **Offline mode:** If the dataset download fails, a built-in 140-email fallback dataset is used automatically. The trained model will be less accurate but fully functional.

Expected output:
```
============================================================
  AI EMAIL SPAM CLASSIFIER - MODEL TRAINING
============================================================

[1/5] Loading dataset...
[2/5] Preprocessing text...
[3/5] Fitting TF-IDF vectorizer...
[4/5] Training all models...
[5/5] Saving model and vectorizer...
  Training complete!
```

## REST API Reference

The backend exposes the following JSON endpoints:

### `POST /api/predict`
Classify an email.

**Request body:**
```json
{ "email": "Your email text here" }
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "prediction": "Spam",
  "confidence": 97.2,
  "riskScore": 88,
  "riskStatus": "High Risk",
  "reasons": ["Financial reward keywords detected: prize, claim"],
  "highlightedWords": ["prize", "claim", "free"],
  "urlAnalysis": { "count": 0, "suspicious": 0, "shortened": 0 },
  "phishingDetected": true,
  "phishingPatterns": ["Click bait link"]
}
```

### `GET /api/history`
Retrieve prediction history. Supports `page`, `limit`, `filter` (spam|ham), and `search` query parameters.

### `DELETE /api/history/<id>`
Delete a specific history record.

### `DELETE /api/history/clear`
Clear all history records.

### `GET /api/stats`
Aggregate statistics for the analytics dashboard.

### `GET /api/model-info`
Training metrics, model comparison, and top spam features.

### `POST /api/upload`
Upload a `.txt` file; returns its text content.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `python` is not recognised
Ensure Python is installed and added to PATH. On macOS/Linux use `python3` instead of `python`.

### `pip install` fails or packages cannot be installed
- Ensure your virtual environment is activated (`(venv)` appears in the prompt)
- Try upgrading pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- If on a restricted network, install packages individually

### `Model not found` error on startup
The model files are missing. Run the training script:
```bash
python train_model.py
```
If the model is included in the repository, ensure the `model/` directory is present and contains `spam_model.pkl` and `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`.

### NLTK `LookupError` or resource not found
The application automatically downloads required NLTK corpora on startup. If the download fails (e.g., no internet access), the error will appear. Connect to the internet and restart.

### Port 5000 already in use
Another process is using port 5000. Either stop that process, or change the port in `app.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=False, host="0.0.0.0", port=5001)
```
Then access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.

### Dataset download fails during training
The fallback 140-email dataset is used automatically. Training will complete, but model accuracy will be lower than reported above. For best results, place the SMS Spam Collection `emails.csv` manually in the `dataset/` folder.

### `ModuleNotFoundError` for any package
Your virtual environment may not be activated. Run:
```powershell
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```
Then re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### `run.bat` fails with "Operation cancelled by user"
Do not press `Ctrl+C` while `run.bat` is installing dependencies. Re-run `.\run.bat` from scratch.

## Limitations

- **Training data scope:** The model is trained on the [SMS Spam Collection](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection) dataset (5,572 short SMS messages). Performance on long-form emails, non-English text, or modern AI-generated spam may vary.
- **Language:** The model supports English only. Non-English emails may produce unpredictable results.
- **False positives/negatives:** No spam classifier is perfect. Legitimate emails containing financial or urgency language may be misclassified as spam, and novel spam not represented in the training data may be missed.
- **Static model:** The model is not retrained automatically. It does not learn from new predictions made through the dashboard.
- **Development server:** The application uses Flask's built-in Werkzeug development server. It is not suitable for production deployment. Use a WSGI server such as Gunicorn for production.
- **Local storage:** All prediction history is stored in a local SQLite file (`database.db`). There is no user authentication, multi-user support, or remote database.
- **No email fetching:** The system does not connect to email servers (IMAP/SMTP). It only analyses text that is pasted or uploaded manually.
